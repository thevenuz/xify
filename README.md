## What is this?

xify - a chrome extension that changes twitter links to vxtwitter links automatically.

## Why?

Coz the twitter embeds failed the tenth time this week and I'm too lazy to manually edit links to vxtwitter everytime I share art on discord.

## How to use?

1. Install the extension from [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xify/cihieeigmpndggpojmhjndlgjdmlgaoe).
2. Go to any twitter.com link and use `Ctrl+Shift+K` shortcut.
3. And that's it, the extension will automatically change the url to `vxtwiiter.com` link.
