## What is this?

xify - a chrome/firefox extension that changes twitter links to vxtwitter/fxtwitter links automatically.

## Why?

Coz the twitter embeds failed the tenth time this week and I'm too lazy to manually edit links to vxtwitter everytime I share art on discord.

## How to use?

### On Chrome

1. Install the extension from [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xify/cihieeigmpndggpojmhjndlgjdmlgaoe).
2. Go to any twitter.com link and use `Ctrl+Shift+K` shortcut.
3. And that's it, the extension will automatically change the url to `vxtwiiter.com`/`fxtwiiter.com` link.

### On Firefox

1. Install the extension from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xify/).
2. Go to any twitter.com link and use `Ctrl+Alt+K` shortcut.
3. And that's it, the extension will automatically change the url to `vxtwiiter.com`/`fxtwiiter.com` link.

### How to switch between vxtwitter and fxtwitter?

By default the extension uses `vxtwitter` links. You can enable the option `Enable fxtwitter` from the extension popup to use `fxtwitter` links instead of `vxtwitter`.
